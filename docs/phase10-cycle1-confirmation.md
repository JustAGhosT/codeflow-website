| High | 5 | S + M + S + L + S | Security vulnerabilities, error handling gaps |
| Medium | 6 | S + M + S + M + M + M | Code quality, maintainability improvements |
| Low | 4 | S + S + S + S | UX polish, observability enhancements |

---

## Cycle 1: Proposed Scope

### Selection Rationale

For the first cycle, we prioritize:
1. **Foundation items** that unblock subsequent improvements
2. **Quick wins** with high impact-to-effort ratio
3. **Security issues** that present immediate risk
4. **Blocking quality gates** to prevent future debt accumulation

### Selected Items (9 items, ~7-8 effort units)

| ID | Description | Severity | Effort | Rationale |
|----|-------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **DEBT-01** | No Test Infrastructure | Critical | M | **FOUNDATION**: Blocks all regression testing; must be first |
| **DEBT-02** | CI Tests Non-Blocking | Critical | M | **QUALITY GATE**: Depends on DEBT-01; prevents broken merges |
| **DEBT-03** | UTF-8 Encoding Corruption | High | S | **QUICK WIN**: Visual quality fix; low risk |
| **DEBT-07** | localStorage Without Error Handling | High | S | **QUICK WIN**: Prevents crashes in edge cases |
| **DEBT-08** | AnimatedBackground Resize Not Debounced | Medium | S | **QUICK WIN**: Performance improvement; low risk |
| **DEBT-10** | Theme Detection Via DOM Class | Medium | S | **QUICK WIN**: Code quality; aligns with React patterns |
| **DEBT-05** | Missing Error Boundaries | High | S | **RESILIENCE**: Prevents full app crashes |
| **DEBT-17** | README Lacks Comprehensive Documentation | Low | S | **DISCOVERY**: Makes new docs discoverable |
| **DEBT-09** | Footer Component Duplication | Medium | M | **MAINTAINABILITY**: Reduces maintenance burden |

**Total Effort**: ~7-8 units (2M + 7S = 2×3 + 7×1 = 13 person-hours estimated)

### Deferred to Future Cycles

| ID | Description | Deferral Reason |
|----|-------------|-----------------|
| DEBT-04 | Undefined CSS Custom Properties | Requires external repo access (codeflow-desktop) |
| DEBT-06 | CSP Security Headers Incomplete | Large effort (L); requires Tailwind nonce strategy |
| DEBT-11 | Feature Cards Not Componentized | Medium priority; focus on foundation first |
| DEBT-12 | Button Styles Inconsistent | Medium priority; design system work |
| DEBT-13 | Missing Storybook | Medium effort; valuable but not blocking |
| DEBT-14 | Missing Loading States | Low priority; UX polish |
| DEBT-15 | No Error Tracking Integration | Low priority; observability enhancement |
| DEBT-16 | No Analytics Integration | Low priority; observability enhancement |

## Implementation Plan Overview

### Phase 1: Foundation (DEBT-01, DEBT-02)
**Effort**: 2M (~6 hours)

#### DEBT-01: Setup Test Infrastructure
- Install Vitest as test framework (aligns with Vite-based tooling)
- Configure `vitest.config.ts` with TypeScript support
- Add `npm test` script to package.json
- Create initial test for a simple component (e.g., ThemeToggle)
- Add test coverage reporting

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests with Vitest
- Component tests with @testing-library/react
- Coverage threshold: 60% minimum (will increase over time)

#### DEBT-02: Make CI Tests Blocking
- Remove `|| true` from test and lint jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Update workflow to fail fast on test/lint failures
- Add branch protection rules documentation

**Dependencies**: Must complete DEBT-01 first

---

### Phase 2: Quick Wins (DEBT-03, DEBT-07, DEBT-08, DEBT-10)
**Effort**: 4S (~4 hours)

#### DEBT-03: Fix UTF-8 Encoding
- Re-save `app/page.tsx` and `app/components/PromoBanner.tsx` with UTF-8 (no BOM)
- Fix corrupted emoji characters
- Add `.editorconfig` to enforce UTF-8 encoding
- Add pre-commit hook to detect BOM markers

**Testing**: Visual regression test for emoji rendering

#### DEBT-07: Add localStorage Error Handling
- Wrap localStorage calls in `app/components/ThemeProvider.tsx` with try-catch
- Add graceful fallback to default theme on storage failure
- Log errors to console for debugging

**Testing**: Unit test for storage failure scenarios

#### DEBT-08: Debounce Resize Handler
- Create `app/utils/debounce.ts` utility function
- Apply debounce (250ms) to resize handler in AnimatedBackground
- Prevent particle re-initialization thrashing

**Testing**: Performance test for resize event handling

#### DEBT-10: Fix Theme Detection
- Import and use `useContext(ThemeContext)` in AnimatedBackground
- Remove DOM class inspection logic
- Ensure theme changes propagate correctly

**Testing**: Unit test for theme context integration

---

### Phase 3: Resilience & Discovery (DEBT-05, DEBT-17)
**Effort**: 2S (~2 hours)

#### DEBT-05: Add Error Boundaries
- Create `app/error.tsx` for route-level error boundary
- Add fallback UI with error message and reset button
- Consider error boundaries for AnimatedBackground (heavy computation)

**Testing**: Error simulation test

#### DEBT-17: Enhance README
- Add "Documentation" section linking to docs/ files
- Document test commands and coverage expectations
- Add design system usage guidelines
- Link to architecture overview and tech stack
- Update contribution guidelines

---

### Phase 4: Refactoring (DEBT-09)
**Effort**: 1M (~3 hours)

#### DEBT-09: Extract Footer Component
- Create `app/components/Footer.tsx` with proper TypeScript types
- Replace footer JSX in all 4 page files
- Ensure consistent styling and links
- Add unit test for Footer component

**Testing**: Snapshot test for visual consistency

## Context Budget Status

| Phase | Tokens Used | Budget | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Phase 0-1 | ~800 | 500-1000 | ✅ Within budget |
| Phase 2-3 | ~950 | 500-1000 | ✅ Within budget |
| Phase 4-5 | ~1200 | 500-1500 | ⚠️ Slightly over (complexity justified) |
| Phase 9 | ~850 | 500-1000 | ✅ Within budget |
| Phase 10 Cycle 1 | ~600 | 500-1000 | ✅ Within budget |

**Total Documentation**: 1,547 lines across 7 files  
**Remaining Debt**: 17 items → 8 items after Cycle 1 (if approved)

---

## Blockers

1. **External Dependency**: DEBT-04 (CSS custom properties) requires access to `codeflow-desktop` repository for design token synchronization
2. **Large Effort**: DEBT-06 (CSP security headers) requires significant Tailwind CSP nonce implementation work

These blockers do not affect Cycle 1 proposed scope.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Awaiting User Response**: Review this confirmation document
2. **Upon CONTINUE**: Begin Phase 7 implementation with DEBT-01 (test infrastructure)
3. **After Implementation**: Run Phase 9 post-implementation review
4. **Update Registry**: Mark resolved items, identify new issues
5. **Iterate**: Start Cycle 2 if debt remains

---

**Document Status**: Ready for user confirmation  
**Proposed File Changes**: 0 (confirmation phase only)  
**Ready State**: Awaiting `CONTINUE`, `CONTINUE NO FILE CHANGES`, or `REVISE` signal
